" 'Agnostic' VIm color scheme
"
" Unlike most of color scheme you will find out there, this one does only what
" it is supposed to do: bind VIm highlight zones to colors, but it does NOT
" define color values. This should be done by your terminal â€“ usually in a
" ~/.Xresources file. This enables the use of your terminal colors inside VIm.
" This color scheme is thus color agnostic.
